# Project Overview:
The project is split into two parts, the first part is a an implementation of a weighted directed graph and path finding algorithms
and the second part is a "Pok√©mon Game" which uses the graph and algorithm to traverse and play the game.

## The First Part
The First Part of the project implemets a graph using 2 hashmaps, a node class and an edge class.

   `private int mc_count;`
   
   `private int edge_count;`
     
  ` private HashMap<Integer, node_data> nodeMap;`
     
   `private HashMap<Integer, HashMap<node_data, edge_data>> edgesMap;`
    
The algoritem class "DWGraph_Algo" implemets path finding algoritems using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.

The Dijkstra algorithm uses Weight that are positive doubles and a priority queue

## The Second Part 
in the second part i implemented the pokemon game on a graph with a Login Menu.
